            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Although there have been many great players in the NBA, none have come close to Michael Jordan.
                    Michael Jordan is the greatest player of all time. I believe this strongly because of the achievments
                    he has earned, his stats, his competitiveness and mentality, and the way other NBA stars and legends talk about him.
                    Its one thing for me to share my opinion, but if the greatest basketball players in the world collectivily agree that 
                    Michael is the G.O.A.T, then that is something to pay attention too.
