                            <p>
                                Had to win the day. Start off each day with something that challenges you. 
                                My challenge that started my day was waking up early and hitting the gym.
                            </p>
                    
                            <p>
                                Every day is meant to be lived. Our minds and bodies desire to be challenged.
                                We need to be actors and not acted upon.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I have the best job in the world. I leave town for a couple months during the summer and I sell pest control.
                                This job has given me great opportunities. It also challenges me each day.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>I had a couple meetings for work scheduled today. Some of these were a few phone calls with people who are interested in 
                                joining the team. There are a selected few who choose to experience this job. I also had a couple trainings 
                                I had to do with some guys from the team so that filled up a good portion of my day.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Life as a student at BYU is super busy. We are just about to enter finals week which makes life even more
                                hectic. I had some homework I had to finish up in a few classes. I'm not sure what major I want to get so most
                                of my classes are just generals. 
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="post-title">Daily Thoughts</h2>
                            <p>
                                A thought that seemed valuable to share was the importance of using time wisely. Something I believe many of 
                                us struggle with is waisting time. Time is a valuable thing. There are only so many minutes in a day and if we
                                choose to waste them, we can never get them back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is something I am trying to change in my life. Living more intentionally. That is one of the reasons I started this blog.
                                To share my experiences with the world and to also recap my day by typing it on "The Daily Spill." If I have nothing good to write about
                                it might mean I have waisted the day. No more days will be waisted.
